# JSONAPI+Arbitrary

See parent project: https://github.com/mattpolzin/JSONAPI

The `JSONAPIArbitrary` framework adds `Arbitrary` support via `SwiftCheck`. With a little extra work on your part, this framework will allow you to create "arbitrary" (i.e. randomly generated) instances of your JSONAPI entities, includes, documents, etc.

This Framework is currently undocumented, but familiarity with `SwiftCheck` will likely afford the user enough information to use this library to aid in the generation of arbitrary JSONAPI Documents for testing purposes.
